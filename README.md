# One-Dimensional-Optimization---Exhaustive-Search
The exhaustive search method can be used to solve problems where the interval in which the optimum is known to lie is ﬁnite. If xs and xf denote, respectively, the starting and ﬁnal points of the interval of uncertainty. The exhaustive search method consists of evaluating the objective function at a predetermined number of equally spaced points in the interval (xs,xf ), and reducing the interval of uncertainty using the assumption of unimodality.  Since the function is evaluated at all n points simultaneously, this method can be called a simultaneous search method. The codSince the function is evaluated at all n points simultaneously, this method can be called a simultaneous search method. e is for the following question : find the minimum of f = x(x −1.5) in the interval (0.0, 1.00) to within 10% of the exact value.
